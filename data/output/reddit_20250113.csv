1i03pk7,Where do you go to stay up to date on data analytics/science?,"Are there any people or organizations you follow on Youtube, Twitter, Medium, LinkedIn, or some other website/blog/podcast that you always tend to keep going back to? 

My previous career absolutely lacked all the professional ""content creators"" that data analytics have, so I was wondering what content you guys tend to consume, if any. Previously I'd go to two sources: one to stay up to date on semi-relevant news, and the other was a source that'd do high level summaries of interesting research papers. 

Really, the kind of stuff would be talking about new tools/products that might be of use, tips and tricks, some re-learning of knowledge you might have learned 10+ years ago, deep dives of random but pertinent topics, or someone that consistently puts out unique visualizations and how to recreate them. You can probably see what I'm getting at: sources for stellar information.",170,19,lowkeyripper,2025-01-13 02:23:54,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1i03pk7/where_do_you_go_to_stay_up_to_date_on_data/,0,False,False,False,False

They continuously post this position and never seem to fill it. Wondering if anyone has gotten an actual interview. I make it to the prescreen rounds  every single time I apply and then it just gets reposted.  ,4,2,tinkinc,2025-01-13 11:42:00,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1i0c3x8/humana_senior_ds_position_merrygoround/,0,False,False,False,False

1i0bhi3,Seeking Advice on GPU Comparison: GreenNode vs FPT,"I’m currently exploring GPU options for my projects and I’m curious if anyone here has experience using GPUs from GreenNode or FPT. I’m looking for real feedback on how they compare in terms of performance, pricing, and overall experience.

Has anyone used GPUs from either of these providers? How do they stack up against each other in terms of power efficiency, speed, and reliability? Are there any specific use cases where one outperforms the other?

I’d love to hear your thoughts, personal experiences, or any suggestions you might have on which GPU might be better for intensive workloads. Thanks in advance!",1,0,jameslee2295,2025-01-13 10:58:39,https://www.reddit.com/r/datascience/comments/1i0bhi3/seeking_advice_on_gpu_comparison_greennode_vs_fpt/,0,False,False,False,False
